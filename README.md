### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Rasmus P

Iâ€™m a full-stack developer from DenmarkðŸ‡©ðŸ‡° with a passion for building seamless and engaging web experiences. I enjoy navigating the space between elegant frontends and solid backend architectureâ€”bringing ideas to life with both creativity and precision.

Driven by curiosity and a love for lifelong learning, Iâ€™m always exploring new technologies and sharing insights with others.
I use HTML, CSS, JavaScript and TypeScript. While I adapt my focus as technologies change, Iâ€™m currently focusing on Vue.js, Nuxt.js, Node.js, aswell as React.js and Serverless architectures.
